tip-calculator
==============
This is a practice run at the prework assignment for the [CodePath application process](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/ios_for_designers/thanks_for_applying). It's a simple tip calculator that allows a person to quickly and easily calculate the tip and total amount of a bill. For more information, check out the [video walkthrough](http://vimeo.com/102084767) of the assignment by Timothy Lee.
